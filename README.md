# 🧠 PERSONAL-PROJECTS

Welcome to my portfolio of quantitative finance and data science projects. These projects were developed during my MSc in Financial Mathematics at the London School of Economics and my MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex. They demonstrate practical applications of statistical modeling, machine learning, and financial theory in real-world scenarios. Most were designed to support internship and job applications in quantitative research, trading, and risk management.
